# learn ansible

This is my attempt to understand concepts and structure of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
and at the same time be able to create something useful and maintainable.

## Requirements

To work on this project you will [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and, of
course, [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). Please refer to the
[Getting Started](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/gettingstarted.html)
documentation on how to obtain Ansible for your platform.

At this time, the following versions were used

- Vagrant 1.3.1 (which supports Ansible)
- Ansible 1.3.0
- Ubuntu 13.04 VM (built with [Packer](http://www.packer.io/))
